# British Airways Reviews Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes customer reviews for British Airways to identify common themes, sentiments, and areas for improvement. The analysis uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and visualize feedback related to various aspects of the flight experience.

## Features

- **Text Transformation**: Clean and preprocess reviews to standardize and prepare them for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Identify the sentiment of reviews to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Topic Modeling**: Extract topics from reviews to identify common themes and concerns.
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Generate word clouds to visualize the most frequent words and phrases in the reviews.
- **Keyword Frequency Analysis**: Analyze the frequency of unigrams and bigrams to identify common issues.

## Installation

To set up and run this project, youâ€™ll need to have Python installed. You can then install the required packages using pip. 

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/british-airways-reviews-analysis.git
    cd british-airways-reviews-analysis
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `nltk`
- `scikit-learn`
- `transformers`
- `wordcloud`

## Usage

1. **Load Data**: Prepare your review dataset in a CSV file and load it into the DataFrame.

2. **Text Transformation**: Use the `transform_text` function to clean and preprocess the review texts.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Apply sentiment analysis to categorize reviews.

4. **Topic Modeling**: Use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract and interpret topics from the reviews.

5. **Word Cloud Visualization**: Generate word clouds to visualize common words in different sentiment categories.

### Example

```python
import pandas as pd
from your_module import transform_text, analyze_reviews

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('reviews.csv')

# Transform text
df['transformed_Message'] = df['Review'].apply(transform_text)

# Analyze reviews
analyze_reviews(df)
```
